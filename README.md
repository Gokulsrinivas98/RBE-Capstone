# Indoor Obstacle Detection And Fire Risk EvaluationÂ Robot
The goal of the project is to make homes safer by developing an indoor autonomous mobile robot that moves around freely and detects obstacles blocking the exit, if any. Furthermore, the robot would notify the user about the obstacle and give out a score on how dangerous that obstacle could be in case of an emergency. The robot was able to successfully detect obstacles in the closest path to the exit and  give out suitable risk scores, in a simulation of house floorplans.
